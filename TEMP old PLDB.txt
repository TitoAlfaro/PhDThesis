This project looks to identify new and radically different mobile experiences while at the same time developing an interaction paradigm that will support such new experiences and be independent of the physical constraints of the device. Digital Synesthesia is a way of using our current mobile technologies to directly affect our sensing system in such a way that the brain will interpret the new input as a new sensory capability. One of the key questions of this research is precisely how capable is our brain in mapping new inputs that could be turned on and off, and how will it assimilate these inputs when used for long periods of time.
